### About

The Hopf Fibration is a fundamental example of a fibre bundle. Named after Heinz Hopf who discovered (1931) a many-to-one continuous function (or "map") from the 3-sphere onto the 2-sphere such that each distinct point of the 2-sphere is mapped from a distinct great circle of the 3-sphere. 

This article details the 6 Hopf projections between the 3-sphere and 2-sphere and illustrates their stereographic projections. Most notably the S1 fibre bundle connecting the 3-sphere and 2-sphere, consisting of the global geometric and dynamics phases, is derived in it's closed form for the first time.
